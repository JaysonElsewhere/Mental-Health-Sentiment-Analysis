I have a range of other issues as well relating to perfectionism and anxiety (probably a result of how much of my self worth derived from my academic success) Although ADHD probably accentuates all of these deeper, underlying issues.\\n\\nAnyway, long story short I might fail my favourite subject due to my excessive procrastination... and also because of how fucking depressed I've been this past month... but I can't blame it just on that, since I've always been a master procrastinator. Anyway, I think the subject tutor will be quite understanding, especially considering I did well in my first assignment... and he is incredibly nice. But I don't know. I guess I might fail... which is putting me under a lot of fucking anxiety.\\n\\nThough I am proud of myself because instead of continually avoiding the problem, I emailed the tutor back within 15 or so minutes of receiving it... so that's a good start. It's just extremely frustrating because I'm so fucking capable, yet so inept at the same time... because of the fucking pathways in my brain.\\n\\nI don't know - feel free to share similar experiences or whatever or advice or anything just so I can feel a little better but even if I do fail, okay whatever, but goddamn I really do not want to fail. I also don't want to succumb to self hatred again either. I really fucking hate this. I feel like a dysfunctional, manic, hyperactive retard :(\\n\\nEDIT: and now I'm having a massive fucking identity crisis and am going absolutely insane and also just took a Valium so I feel insanely disorientated and depressed goddamn it help</td>\n",

Took it for a few weeks but it didn't help with focus at all, even making it worse. The only noticeable thing it did do was give me lots of energy and make me fidgety and shaky and making my mood go way up. And then I could tell when it wore off because I'd feel randomly depressed at night after taking it almost every night for no explainable reason.\\n\\nStopped taking that and my doctor has me on Vyvanse now but I've only been taking it a few days and it seems to be doing the same thing? Today I seemed to have the weirdest kind of anxiety attack but felt fine before and then it wore off and now depression sinks in. Before that I spent probably 2 hours lying on the floor just tapping my foot because I had no motivation to do anything at all.\\n\\n Shouldn't I be able to notice even the slightest improvement in my concentration with stimulants and what could it mean if these drugs don't affect me at all the way they should?</td>\n",

The pain is sharp and comes in waves. It feels like the muscles in my chest are contracting and It makes it very difficult to breathe. The pain sometimes reaches my arms, jaw and belly. IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve talked to various people who also experience anxiety but IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve never met someone who has these pains like I do. IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve had physicals and an EKG and IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m healthy, the only thing to note is a vitamin d deficiency.    \n",

I've had this issue for a very long while now, and it's quite embarrassing when people notice how messed up my fingers are... but i just *cant stop* once I've started. This can be triggered easily by anxiety for me.\\n\\nIt's also part of a compulsion for me.. and I've been wondering if I have a skin picking disorder, but that, in itself, gives me anxiety just thinking about it.    \n",

       "11695  I'm not going to attribute all of my procrastination and disorganisation to ADHD... I have a range of other issues as well relating to perfectionism and anxiety (probably a result of how much of my self worth derived from my academic success) Although ADHD probably accentuates all of these deeper, underlying issues.\\n\\nAnyway, long story short I might fail my favourite subject due to my excessive procrastination... and also because of how fucking depressed I've been this past month... but I can't blame it just on that, since I've always been a master procrastinator. Anyway, I think the subject tutor will be quite understanding, especially considering I did well in my first assignment... and he is incredibly nice. But I don't know. I guess I might fail... which is putting me under a lot of fucking anxiety.\\n\\nThough I am proud of myself because instead of continually avoiding the problem, I emailed the tutor back within 15 or so minutes of receiving it... so that's a good start. It's just extremely frustrating because I'm so fucking capable, yet so inept at the same time... because of the fucking pathways in my brain.\\n\\nI don't know - feel free to share similar experiences or whatever or advice or anything just so I can feel a little better but even if I do fail, okay whatever, but goddamn I really do not want to fail. I also don't want to succumb to self hatred again either. I really fucking hate this. I feel like a dysfunctional, manic, hyperactive retard :(\\n\\nEDIT: and now I'm having a massive fucking identity crisis and am going absolutely insane and also just took a Valium so I feel insanely disorientated and depressed goddamn it help   \n",

Took it for a few weeks but it didn't help with focus at all, even making it worse. The only noticeable thing it did do was give me lots of energy and make me fidgety and shaky and making my mood go way up. And then I could tell when it wore off because I'd feel randomly depressed at night after taking it almost every night for no explainable reason.\\n\\nStopped taking that and my doctor has me on Vyvanse now but I've only been taking it a few days and it seems to be doing the same thing? Today I seemed to have the weirdest kind of anxiety attack but felt fine before and then it wore off and now depression sinks in. Before that I spent probably 2 hours lying on the floor just tapping my foot because I had no motivation to do anything at all.\\n\\n Shouldn't I be able to notice even the slightest improvement in my concentration with stimulants and what could it mean if these drugs don't affect me at all the way they should?   \n",
