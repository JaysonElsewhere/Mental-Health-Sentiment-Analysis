THAT made me feel like king of the world!\\n\\nI'm still learning how to deal with anxiety and this is the first time I've conquered it in a HEALTHY way that my wife even acknowledged! It feels really good and I wanted to share! Best of luck to everyone else out there, and know that you CAN do it! Just keep on keepin' on!   \n",

Despite knowing that I am not all the things I have been labelled/described as my entire life, its one thing to rationalize a medical condition that you have and the symptoms that come with it, its an entirely different thing to stop believing that I am somehow \"less\" than everyone else because of all the times as a child/teenager I was put down and punished for displaying signs of a disorder I didn't even know I had.

I went to the doctor after seeing a therapist a couple of times, and he prescribed me paxil for my social anxiety. I don't know much about it but seems like there are some serious side effects relating to suicide and depression, as well as loss of libido (which I'm not really ok with). Also the withdrawal effects are long-lasting. I'm a bit scared to take the pill after reading about it, especially since it'll be one I'll have to take daily. I heard good things about klonopin and was hoping the doc would prescribe that to me. Should I give paxil a try, or ask the doctor for klonopin instead?   \n",

Update: day 2 - headache, lightheaded, dizzy, head feels heavy, no improved focus, could fall asleep, nauseous, medicinal taste in mouth. \\n\\nEdit 2. Nevermind. Can't sleep, physically tired and ill but mind is racing. Could just be agitated about the situation though\\n\\nEdit 3. I believe things have evened out. After taking an extra dose yesterday and altering my method of ingestion, things seem to have gotten better. Still not the same as my prior brand but effective enough. Headaches are gone. The only thing I've been dealing with today is a little bit of unwanted hyperfocus on extraneous activities. It seems it may even last longer than my prior brand, which is good. On the downside, it doesn't quite as effective and requires an administration method that is needlessly laborious, rather unpleasant, and possibly wasteful. To be clear, I've taken the regular dose today but have been supplementing with b complex vitamins and a good bit of caffeine.   \n",

       "      <td>I'm 51 and diag'd w/ADHD a year ago. Doc started me off on what he called \"the Cadillac of ADD meds,\" Vyvanse (12hr). That was alright, but left me no control over my situation - I HAD to be dosed up all day long. It ruined my sleep schedule, and even worse made my digestive tract a stellar mess. So I switched to Adderall 30 IR. I break them up into quarters and take them about 4 hrs apart throughout the day to give me an even and smoother dosing, which allows me to stop taking it about 3-5 hrs before bedtime. If I didn't do that, I'd be up way too late and my schedule would keep shifting off by an hour or two every day.\\n\\nBut it seems I'm running into a problem...\\n\\nSome nights, if I have been off the med for a few hours and I'm tired, the unholy dark passenger of rage that has lived inside me since I was brought into this world can explode with untold fury if provoked. Last night I burst into a rage that was near-blackout level, but not quite. I exploded at a beloved family member (also struggling with ADHD but as-of-yet unmedicated) and though he is an adult male, he immediately fell into an intense state of fear due to my explosive rage. The rage was triggered by something he said, but in all honesty, what he said is not the kind of thing that would normally (either on meds, or prior to taking any ADHD meds) upset me like that. \\n\\nSo I started to wonder, does anyone else have a problem with emotional regulation when your meds wear off? Or am I an anomaly? I have to admit, feeling like I can explode like that without the medication worries me and I am starting to wonder who, or what, I might be if I were to stop? Does taking these meds for too long a time and then stopping them cause deleterious problems? Or do they eventually help you to \"get over\" being ADHD? I honestly doubt that anything could help us get over this ... nightmare... of a dis-ease. It's a real bitch, no matter how you slice or dice it. \\n\\nAny thoughts or advice would be greatly appreciated. And to those of you struggling with this thing, my heart goes out to you.</td>\n",

       "8330   I'm 51 and diag'd w/ADHD a year ago. Doc started me off on what he called \"the Cadillac of ADD meds,\" Vyvanse (12hr). That was alright, but left me no control over my situation - I HAD to be dosed up all day long. It ruined my sleep schedule, and even worse made my digestive tract a stellar mess. So I switched to Adderall 30 IR. I break them up into quarters and take them about 4 hrs apart throughout the day to give me an even and smoother dosing, which allows me to stop taking it about 3-5 hrs before bedtime. If I didn't do that, I'd be up way too late and my schedule would keep shifting off by an hour or two every day.\\n\\nBut it seems I'm running into a problem...\\n\\nSome nights, if I have been off the med for a few hours and I'm tired, the unholy dark passenger of rage that has lived inside me since I was brought into this world can explode with untold fury if provoked. Last night I burst into a rage that was near-blackout level, but not quite. I exploded at a beloved family member (also struggling with ADHD but as-of-yet unmedicated) and though he is an adult male, he immediately fell into an intense state of fear due to my explosive rage. The rage was triggered by something he said, but in all honesty, what he said is not the kind of thing that would normally (either on meds, or prior to taking any ADHD meds) upset me like that. \\n\\nSo I started to wonder, does anyone else have a problem with emotional regulation when your meds wear off? Or am I an anomaly? I have to admit, feeling like I can explode like that without the medication worries me and I am starting to wonder who, or what, I might be if I were to stop? Does taking these meds for too long a time and then stopping them cause deleterious problems? Or do they eventually help you to \"get over\" being ADHD? I honestly doubt that anything could help us get over this ... nightmare... of a dis-ease. It's a real bitch, no matter how you slice or dice it. \\n\\nAny thoughts or advice would be greatly appreciated. And to those of you struggling with this thing, my heart goes out to you.    \n",

Ever since I was a kid sunsets have always given me a strange feeling. I can't tell if it's good or bad, it seems completely neutral and very hard to explain. It feels familier and safe but also scary and wrong, like something bad is about to happen. I didn't motice it for years but it's come back very strongly within the last few months. I have suffered with anxiety all my life but I only really have good memories regarding sunsets. I also suffered depersonalisation for almost two years, which recently went away in November, and since then the feeling has reappeared. I still dissociate, usually derealisation. \\n\\nDoes anyone else get this feeling with anything? \\n   \n",

I struggled throughout my academic career and now I teach at a big fancy international private school and I love every minute of my hectic and busy job.  This is similar to Wednesday Win but I thought it could double as a way of showcasing ADHD friendly jobs for people struggling to get where some of us already are.   \n",

Has anyone experienced anxiety attacks brought on by imagining yourself having one? My brother is suffering with regular anxiety attacks, or at least having to fight them off quite regularly.\\n\\nHe explained that they are brought on when he is in a situation that he feels he'd be embarrassed or trapped IF it happened.\\n\\nExample. In his workplace, he finds that sometimes if he's in a meeting - a situation where IF an attack came over him, he couldn't just leave the room as it would cause a scene and he'd be embarrassed. \\nAnd just by thinking about the possibility of an attack happening, and how awful it would be, this often brings on bad anxiety and he has to fight it off really hard. \\n\\nHe has realised that he should probably seek help, but is quite a cynical guy and I don't think he'll be very proactive about it. So I'm hoping maybe someone could give me some ideas so I could communicate some to him. \\n\\nThanks so much in advance. Any questions fire away. \\n\\n   \n",

I feel like my anxiety manifests physically in different ways at different times. How do you experience yours?\\n\\nOne of the most prominent symptoms is that I have extremely prominent heart palpitations, which feels like you can feel your heart beating into your throat. I also begin to get a shortness of breath and dizziness. This doesnt even happen when i have a panic attack. My panic attacks magnifies theae symptoms and then I start talking fast and can't stop talking. It almost sounds like hysteria when im in the middle of a panic attack. \\n\\nI have diagnosed severe anxiety and depression. I take a mixture of prozac and xanax on a regular basis... I hate how it makes me feel, like a zombie that is no longer emotionally affected by anything (maybe its too strong a dose?). I try to be off my meds as much as I can because of my desire to feel normal and I have had these symptoms since I was a teen (currenrly 26 years old).   \n",
